Retail Customer Analysis
This project performs a comprehensive customer analysis for a retail store, leveraging transaction, customer, and product hierarchy data. The analysis aims to provide insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product popularity across various demographics and store types.

Project Structure
Customer.csv: Contains customer demographic information.

prod_cat_info.csv: Contains product category and sub-category information.

Transactions.csv: Contains details of customer transactions.

retail_customer_analysis.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that performs data loading, merging, cleaning, analysis, and generates visualizations.

Customer_Final.csv: The merged and processed dataset generated by the Jupyter Notebook.

retail_dashboard.html: An HTML dashboard that visualizes key insights from the analysis.

Analysis Report
The retail_customer_analysis.ipynb notebook performs the following key steps and provides the subsequent insights:

1. Data Merging and Preparation
The Customer.csv, prod_cat_info.csv, and Transactions.csv datasets were loaded.

Columns were renamed for consistent merging (cust_id to customer_Id, prod_sub_cat_code to prod_subcat_code).

The datasets were merged into a final DataFrame named Customer_Final. An inner merge was used to ensure only customers with transactions are included.

Robustness checks were implemented to ensure the merged DataFrame is not empty and contains all necessary columns for analysis.

2. Summary Report for Customer_Final
Column Names and Data Types: A detailed overview of all columns and their respective data types was generated.

Top/Bottom 10 Observations: Displayed the first and last 10 rows of the merged dataset for quick inspection.

Five-Number Summary: Calculated the minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum for all continuous variables (Age, Qty, Rate, Tax, total_amt).

Frequency Tables: Generated frequency distributions for all categorical variables (Gender, City_Code, Store_type, prod_cat, prod_subcat).

3. Visualizations
Histograms: Created histograms with KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) for continuous variables (Age, Qty, Rate, Tax, total_amt) to show their distribution.

Frequency Bar Charts: Generated bar charts for categorical variables (Gender, City_Code, Store_type, prod_cat, prod_subcat) to visualize the count of observations in each category.

4. Key Business Insights
The analysis addressed several specific business questions:

Time Period of Transaction Data: The available transaction data spans from 2011-01-25 to 2014-12-02.

Negative Transactions: There were 2177 transactions where the total amount was negative, indicating product returns.

Product Categories Popularity by Gender: The analysis revealed which product categories (e.g., Electronics, Books, Home and Kitchen) are more frequently purchased by male versus female customers based on total quantity sold.

City with Maximum Customers: The city with City_Code 4 has the maximum number of unique customers, accounting for a significant percentage of the total customer base.

Store Type Sales Performance: The analysis identified which store types sell the maximum products by both value (total amount earned) and quantity (total units sold).

Earnings from Specific Categories and Stores: The total amount earned from "Electronics" and "Clothing" categories specifically from "Flagship Stores" was calculated.

Earnings from Male Customers (Electronics): The total amount earned from "Male" customers under the "Electronics" category was determined.

Customers with High Transaction Volume: The number of customers who have made more than 10 unique positive transactions (excluding returns) was identified.

Spending Habits of 25-35 Age Group:

The total amount spent by customers aged between 25 and 35 on "Electronics" and "Books" product categories was calculated.

The total amount spent by these customers between January 1, 2014, and March 1, 2014, was also determined.

How to Use the Dashboard
The retail_dashboard.html file provides an interactive visualization of some of the key findings.

To view the dashboard:ðŸ‘‰ [Open retail.html](https://rahulraimau.github.io/rahulraimau/retail.html)

Run the Jupyter Notebook first: Ensure you have executed all cells in retail_customer_analysis.ipynb. This notebook generates the Customer_Final.csv file, which the HTML dashboard relies on.

Open retail_dashboard.html: Navigate to the directory where you saved retail_dashboard.html and Customer_Final.csv. Open retail_dashboard.html directly in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

The dashboard will load the data and display interactive charts summarizing customer and sales trends.
